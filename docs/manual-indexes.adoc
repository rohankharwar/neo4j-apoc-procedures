= Manual Indexes

== Data Used

In the below examples I used the flight data setup from the following link:

== Adding Manual Index on Node Property


In order to create manual index on node property , one will have to to use the the APOC stored procedure - `apoc.index.addNode`.

----
match (f:Flight)
call apoc.index.addNode(f,["flight_num"])
return count(f)
----

The above statement will create the node index with the same name as the Label name in this case `Flight` and add the nodes to the index.

Once this has been added check if the node index exists using the stored procedure `apoc.index.list`.

//Check if any legacy index exists
----
CALL apoc.index.list() YIELD type,name,config
----

Better option would be to use the `apoc.index.addNode` as part of the loading process or `LOAD CSV` script.

Once the node index is created we can start using it.
Here are some examples.

The below query returns distinct Airport and City for Flight Number `43`.
Query can be written with the help of stored procedure `apoc.index.nodes` as given below.

----
call apoc.index.nodes('Flight','flight_num:43') YIELD node
match (node)-[:DESTINATION]->(a:Airport)-[:IN_CITY]->(c:City)
return distinct a.name, c.name limit 10
----

To Remove the node index `Flight` created -

----
CALL apoc.index.remove('Flight')
----

== Adding Manual Index on Relationship Property


In order to create manual index on relationship property , one will have to to use the the APOC stored procedure - `apoc.index.addRelationship`.

----
match (f:Flight)-[r:DESTINATION]->(a:Airport)
with r
call apoc.index.addRelationship(r,["taxi_time"])
return count(r)
----

The above statement will create the auto index with the same name as Relationship name in this case `DESTINATION` and adds the relationship to the index.

Once this has been added check if the relationship index exists using the stored procedure `apoc.index.list`.

//Check if any legacy index exists
----
CALL apoc.index.list() YIELD type,name,config
----

Output:

Once the relationship index is created we can start using it.
Here are some examples.

Below query will give me the count of the relationship `DESTINATION` with the property `taxi_time = 11`.
Query can be written with the help of a stored procedure `apoc.index.relationships`.

----
call apoc.index.relationships('DESTINATION','taxi_time:11') YIELD rel
return count(rel)
----

Another example query is to return the Flight Number and the Airport Name for those flights that had the `taxi_time` of 11 mins. The query can be written with the help of stored procedure `apoc.index.relationships` as given below.

----
call apoc.index.relationships('DESTINATION','taxi_time:11') YIELD rel
with rel , startnode(rel) as a, endnode(rel) as b
return a.flight_num, b.name limit 10
----


Below is an example of a query using the stored procedure `apoc.index.in` to get the start nodes for all the `DESTINATION` relationships with incoming nodes to the `Airport` node where Airport is `SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL`.

----
match (a:Airport {name:"SAN DIEGO INTERNATIONAL"}) with a
call apoc.index.in(a,"DESTINATION","taxi_time:11") YIELD node
return node
----

Similarly here is an example of a query using stored procedure `apoc.index.out`. This query gets the Airport Name i.e. end nodes for the relationship `DESTINATION` for all the flight nodes with `flight_num = 43` .

----
match (a:Flight {flight_num:43}) with a
call apoc.index.out(a,"DESTINATION","taxi_time:11") YIELD node
return node
----

To Remove the relationship index `DESTINATION` created -

----
CALL apoc.index.remove('DESTINATION') 
----
